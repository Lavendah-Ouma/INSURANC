Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA involves examining the data to identify patterns, relationships, and other features that can be used to gain insight into the underlying structure of the data. Data visualization tools such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps can be used to visualize the data and aid in the EDA process.

The data set includes the following variables:

• age: age of policyholder
• sex: gender of policyholder
• bmi: body mass index of policyholder
• children: number of children/dependents of policyholder
• smoker: whether the policyholder smokes or not
• region: the region of the country where the policyholder lives
• charges: amount charged for the insurance policy

To begin the EDA process, we can examine the distributions of the data by creating histograms for each variable.

We can also examine the relationships between the variables by creating scatter plots for each pair of variables.

We can also use box plots to examine the distributions of the variables by categorical variables such as sex and region.

Finally, we can use heatmaps to examine the correlations between the variables.

Using Linear Regression to Train the Data:

Linear regression is a technique used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, we will use linear regression to model the linear relationship between the charges variable (dependent variable) and the other variables (independent variables).

To evaluate the performance of the model, we can calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) , Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model. The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. The RMSE measures the average magnitude of the error, with consideration of the direction. The MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors.
